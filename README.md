# Simple Sprites

Simple Sprites is a Photoshop plug-in that takes a directory of image files and creates a CSS sprite map.

## Installation

Though the plug-in can be run without installing, you may wish to add it permanently to your Photoshop installation. To do so, simply copy simple-sprites.jsx to "Adobe Photoshop CS5/Presets/Scripts".
